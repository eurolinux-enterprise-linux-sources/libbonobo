	    Bonobo component reference counting, version 0.1

	<refsect2><title>Bonobo Objects</title>

	    <para>
		A bonobo object is a glib object that implements an
		CORBA interface, it also contains a pointer to the
		BonoboAggregateObject that it is part of. A bonobo
		object has two reference counts; the first is a
		GObject reference count on the object. This should
		be 1 at all times except pre-finalization. The main
		reference count for the aggregate is stored in
		the</para>
	    <programlisting>
typedef struct {
	int   ref_count;
	GList *objs;
} BonoboAggregateObject;
	    </programlisting>
	    <para>structure. Also in this structure is a list of all
		the objects implementing other interfaces in this
		aggregate. Clearly an object is always in its own
		aggregate hence:</para>
	    <programlisting>
g_assert (g_list_find (object-&gt;priv-&gt;ao-&gt;objs, object) == object);
	    </programlisting>

	    <para>Is always true. The
		<structfield>object-&gt;priv-&gt;ao</structfield>
		dereference is merely a nice way of encapsulating this
		information inside
		<filename>bonobo-object.c</filename> and ensuring that
		it can't be fiddled with elsewhere.</para>

	</refsect2>

	<refsect2><title>Ref counting</title>

	    <para> The only ref count to manipulate is that on the
		aggregate obejct, this is done via the
		<function>bonobo_object_ref / unref</function> pair,
		it is also done remotely via the
		<function>Bonobo_Object_ref / unref</function> CORBA
		stubs. There is no 'destroy' method, if you want this
		method you are probably confused about how GObject
		deals with allocation.</para>

	    <para>
		Some people try to use <function>g_object_ref /
		unref</function> on
		<classname>BonoboObjects</classname>; sadly this will
		cause very serious grief. This if you
		<function>g_object_unref</function> a bonobo object,
		then that object will be destroyed without consulting
		the aggregate ref-count, and without sorting out the
		aggregate. The net effect of this is that the
		aggregate is left including a finalized object. This
		is a very bad move indeed.</para>
	</refsect2>

	<refsect2><title>Reference leaks</title>

	    <para>
		Catching reference leaks is evily difficult. The first
		approach is to set environment variable
		<envar>BONOBO_DEBUG_FLAGS</envar> to a colon separated
		list of a subset of {object, running, aggregate,
		lifecycle, refs}. This will enable debugging output in
		certain parts of libbonobo. The output will be written
		to stdout or, alternatively, if you set
		<envar>BONOBO_DEBUG_DIR</envar> to a directory path,
		to a file named
		<filename>bonobo-debug-&lt;pid&gt;</filename> in that
		directory. This combined with a call to
	<!-- FIXME: Shouldn't this be bonobo_debug_shutdown()??? -->
		<function>bonobo_shutdown ()</function> before exiting
		your program should provide a dump of all object
		references floating in your code.</para>

	    <para>Another good way of catching leaks---having guessed
		which object is not getting freed---is to fire up
		container and component in gdb, break in
		eg. bonobo_embeddable_new and insert a hardware watch
		point on the ref count [ see also <xref
		linkend="debugging"/> ]:</para>

	    <programlisting>
(gdb) p &amp;((BonoboObject *)embeddable)-&gt;priv-&gt;ao-&gt;ref_count
$N = (int *) 0x80808102
(gdb) watch *0x80808102
(gdb) cont
	    </programlisting>

	    <para>
		This will result in gdb giving you control each time
		the ref count is changed. At this point halt the other
		end of the CORBA link and start logging traces at both
		ends. By the time the program exits you should have
		worked out where the reference went astray.</para>

	<refsect2><title>Ref Counting Conventions</title>
	    <para>And now for the important stuff:</para>

	    <refsect3><title>Bonobo Ref Counting</title>
		
		<para>The Bonobo ref count convention is as follows.
		    (Mild rewording; same meaning as before)</para>
		<orderedlist>

		    <listitem><para> A function returning an object,
			either as the return value or by-reference,
			must always add a reference before returning.
			(Alternately: the callee must create a
			reference to the returned object that the
			caller owns)</para></listitem>

		    <listitem><para> A function that accepts a bonobo
			object as an in/out parameter must unreference
			the originally passed object once if the
			function wishes to change the value of the
			in/out parameter.  (The function must ref()
			new objects returned via this in/out in
			accordance with [1]) </para></listitem>

		    <listitem><para> An object passed into a function
			needs only be ref()'d if the ifunction wishes
			to retain a reference to the object beyond the
			scope of the function call.</para></listitem>

		</orderedlist>

		<para>In addition, there's a consensus that interface
		    designers should be advised against designing
		    methods with in/out parameters.  In/out parameters
		    can obscure the lifetime of the passed argument to
		    casual code observers, and thus may cause hidden
		    side-effects.</para>

	    </refsect3>

	    <refsect3><title>CORBA Ref-counting</title>

		<para>Since the ORB also maintains reference counts
		    per interface handle, should you be returning a
		    reference to an object it is imperative to</para>
		<programlisting>
Bonobo_Unknown_ref (corba_object, ev);
return CORBA_Object_duplicate (corba_object, ev);
		</programlisting>
		<para> To assist with this there are two functions:</para>
		<synopsis>
Bonobo_Unknown bonobo_object_dup_ref       (Bonobo_Unknown     object,
                                            CORBA_Environment *ev);
void           bonobo_object_release_unref (Bonobo_Unknown     object,
                                            CORBA_Environment *ev);
		</synopsis>

		<para>
		    So to return an Unknown from a impl you can simply:</para>
		<programlisting>
return bonobo_object_dup_ref (corba_object, ev);</programlisting>

		<warning>
		    <para>there is a caveat with this approach which is this:</para>

		    <para>If you construct a BonoboObject in an impl_
			whose reference you wish to hand back to the
			caller then the situation is slightly
			different. In this case you have an object
			with the following:</para>
		    <para>Bonobo_Unknown: ref 1</para>
		    <para>BonoboObject:   ref 1</para>

		    <para>
			You want to hand a CORBA reference to this
			object to the client, without incrementing the
			BonoboObject reference. To do this you must
			do:</para>
		    <programlisting>
return CORBA_Object_duplicate (BONOBO_OBJREF (myobject));
		    </programlisting>

		    <para>The mirror of this is that if you want to
			hand a ref to an impl you will need to
			CORBA_Object_duplicate the value before
			inserting it into a BonoboObjectClient.</para>
		</warning>

	    </refsect3>

	    <refsect3><title>Ref counting and one-way methods</title>

		<para>While the ORB has built in support for correct
		    referencing on 1 way methods, the Bonobo reference
		    count does not; hence if you wish to hand a bonobo
		    reference to several listeners you need to do
		    something like:</para>
		
		<programlisting>
ref = Bonobo_Unknown_ref (BONOBO_OBJREF (obj), ev);
Bonobo_Sample_executeOnewayMethod (foo, ref, ev);
		</programlisting>
		
		<para>And at the other end in executeOnewayMethod the
		    reference needs to be released.</para>
